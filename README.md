# To-Do List App

A simple, interactive, and responsive web-based to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to manage their tasks by adding new ones, marking them as completed, editing their descriptions, and deleting them. Tasks are persisted in the browser's local storage.

## Features

* **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks using an input field and an "Add Task" button.
* **Mark as Complete:** Check/uncheck tasks to mark them as completed or incomplete.
* **Edit Tasks:** Double-click on a task or click the edit icon to modify its description.
* **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
* **Persistence:** Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they remain even if you close and reopen the browser.
* **Responsive Design:** The application is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the core structure of the application.
* **CSS3:** For styling and ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactive functionalities, including task management and local storage integration.
